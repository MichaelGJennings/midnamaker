# NameSet Editing Support - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Added comprehensive support for editing NameSets in the MIDNAMaker application. NameSets define which patch banks are available on which MIDI channels, providing a way to organize device configurations by channel availability.

## Phases Completed

### Phase 1A: Data Restructuring ✓
**Files Modified:**
- `server.py` (lines 803-907)
- `js/core/app.js` (lines 404-455)
- `js/modules/manufacturer.js` (lines 494-541)

**Changes:**
- Updated server to extract `custom_device_modes` and `channel_name_sets` with full hierarchy
- PatchBanks are now properly associated with their parent ChannelNameSets
- Added backward compatibility for flat patch_banks structure
- Frontend now organizes patchList with ChannelNameSet metadata (name, availableChannels)

**Data Structure:**
```javascript
// Old structure (flat):
patchList: [
  { name: "Bank 1", patches: [...] },
  { name: "Bank 2", patches: [...] }
]

// New structure (with NameSet metadata):
patchList: [
  { 
    name: "Bank 1", 
    channelNameSet: "Name Set 1",
    availableChannels: [...],
    patches: [...]
  }
]
```

### Phase 1B: Patch Bank Header Labels ✓
**Files Modified:**
- `js/modules/device.js` (lines 272-320, 361-400)

**Changes:**
- Added `formatChannelAvailability()` helper method to format channel ranges
  - Example: "(Channels 1-9, 11-16)" for channels excluding #10
  - Example: "(Channel 10)" for single channel
- Patch bank headers now display: "Part of NameSet: **Name Set 1** (Channels 1-16)"

### Phase 2: Moveable Patch Banks ✓
**Files Modified:**
- `js/modules/device.js` (lines 369-399, 1703-1730)

**Changes:**
- In edit mode, the NameSet label becomes a dropdown showing all available NameSets
- Added `movePatchBankToNameSet(listIndex, newNameSet)` method
- Moving a bank updates its ChannelNameSet association and channel availability
- Re-renders the view after move and logs the action

### Phase 3: NameSet Display Section ✓
**Files Modified:**
- `js/modules/device.js` (lines 344-345, 453-518)

**Changes:**
- Added new "NameSets" section after Patch Banks
- Each NameSet is displayed as a card showing:
  - NameSet name and channel availability (formatted as ranges)
  - List of patch banks within the NameSet
  - Channel editor (hidden by default, shown in edit mode)
  - Action buttons: Edit, Duplicate, Delete
- Section includes descriptive text explaining the purpose of NameSets

### Phase 4: NameSet Editing Features ✓
**Files Modified:**
- `js/modules/device.js` (lines 1800-1952)

**Changes:**
- **Edit:** `editNameSet(index)` - Toggles channel availability editor visibility
- **Channel Availability Editor:** 16 checkboxes (one per MIDI channel) arranged in 8x2 grid
- **Update Channels:** `updateChannelAvailability(nameSetIndex, channelNum, isAvailable)` 
  - Updates NameSet and all associated patch banks
- **Add:** `addNameSet()` - Creates new NameSet with unique name, all channels enabled by default
- **Duplicate:** `duplicateNameSet(index)` - Deep copies NameSet (but not patch banks)
- **Delete:** `deleteNameSet(index)` - Validates no patch banks are using it before deletion
  - Shows alert with list of dependent patch banks if deletion is blocked

### Phase 5: CSS Styling ✓
**Files Modified:**
- `css/device.css` (lines 1063-1198)

**Changes:**
- Added comprehensive styles for NameSet UI components:
  - `.nameset-card` - Card container styling
  - `.nameset-header` - Header with name and actions
  - `.channel-availability` - Pill-style channel range display
  - `.nameset-banks` - List of patch banks in NameSet
  - `.channel-editor` - Collapsible editor panel
  - `.channel-grid` - 8-column grid for channel checkboxes
  - `.nameset-selector` - Dropdown styling for moving banks

### Phase 6: Server-Side Save Support ✓
**Files Modified:**
- `server.py` (lines 270-344, 310-379)

**Changes:**
- Refactored `save_midnam_structure()` to handle hierarchical ChannelNameSet structure
- Added helper methods:
  - `_update_patch_bank(patch_bank_elem, frontend_bank)` - Updates existing PatchBank XML
  - `_create_patch_bank(parent_elem, frontend_bank)` - Creates new PatchBank XML
- Save logic now:
  1. Updates AvailableForChannels for each ChannelNameSet
  2. Groups patch banks by their parent ChannelNameSet
  3. Removes, updates, or creates banks within the correct NameSet
  4. Preserves MIDI commands and patch data
- Maintains proper XML structure with correct parent-child relationships

## Key Features

### Channel Availability Formatting
The system intelligently formats channel availability:
- Single channel: "(Channel 10)"
- Range: "(Channels 1-9)"
- Multiple ranges: "(Channels 1-9, 11-16)"
- All channels: "(All Channels)"

### Data Flow
1. **Load:** Server extracts hierarchical structure → Frontend organizes by NameSet
2. **Edit:** User modifies NameSets/moves banks → State updates, UI re-renders
3. **Save:** Frontend sends hierarchical data → Server updates XML preserving structure

### Backward Compatibility
- Falls back to flat patch_banks structure if channel_name_sets not present
- Existing devices without NameSets continue to work
- Server maintains both hierarchical and flat representations

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Load Test:**
   - Open a device with multiple ChannelNameSets (e.g., Yamaha CS1X, QuasiMIDI Sirius)
   - Verify patch banks show correct NameSet labels
   - Verify channel availability displays correctly

2. **Move Test:**
   - Edit a patch bank
   - Move it to a different NameSet via dropdown
   - Verify it appears in the new NameSet's bank list
   - Save and reload to verify persistence

3. **Edit Test:**
   - Click "Edit" on a NameSet
   - Toggle channel checkboxes
   - Verify channel availability label updates
   - Verify associated banks update
   - Save and reload to verify persistence

4. **Add/Duplicate Test:**
   - Add new NameSet (all channels enabled by default)
   - Duplicate existing NameSet
   - Verify unique naming (Name Set 2, Name Set 1 Copy 1, etc.)

5. **Delete Test:**
   - Try to delete NameSet with banks (should show error)
   - Move banks to another NameSet
   - Delete empty NameSet (should succeed)

## File Change Summary

**Server-Side:**
- `server.py` - 180 lines modified (data extraction + save logic)

**Client-Side:**
- `js/core/app.js` - 60 lines modified (data transformation)
- `js/modules/manufacturer.js` - 50 lines modified (data transformation)
- `js/modules/device.js` - 280 lines added (display + editing logic)
- `css/device.css` - 135 lines added (styling)

**Total:** ~705 lines of new/modified code

## Future Enhancements (Not Implemented)

1. **NameSet Name Editing:** Currently names are not editable in the UI
2. **Multiple CustomDeviceModes:** Infrastructure is in place but UI doesn't support multiple modes yet
3. **ChannelNameSetAssignments Editing:** Assignments stay synced with AvailableForChannels for now
4. **Drag-and-Drop:** Could add drag-and-drop to move banks between NameSets
5. **Bulk Operations:** Select multiple banks and move them together

## Example Files for Testing

The following files have interesting NameSet configurations:
- **Yamaha CS1X** (`patchfiles/Yamaha_CS1X.midnam`) - 2 NameSets, channel 1 vs channels 5-16
- **QuasiMIDI Sirius** (`patchfiles/QuasiMIDI Sirius.midnam`) - 5 NameSets, one per channel type
- **Korg Kross 2** - Multiple CustomDeviceModes (complex structure)
- **Novation Nova** - Multiple NameSets with overlapping channels
- **Roland XV-2020** - Complex multi-mode device
- **Yamaha PSR_S900** - Multi-part NameSet configuration
