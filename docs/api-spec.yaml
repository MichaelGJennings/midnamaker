  description: |
    REST API for managing MIDI Name Documents (.midnam files) and MIDI Device Type files (.middev).
    
    MIDNAMaker is an editor for creating and managing MIDI device definitions that follow
    the MIDI Manufacturers Association's MIDI Name Document specification.
    
    ## Deployment Modes
    
    MIDNAMaker supports two deployment modes:
    
    **Local Server** (full functionality):
    - File save operations to disk
    - Full read/write access to MIDNAM files
    - Cache management
    - File uploads
    
    **Vercel Hosted** (read-only serverless):
    - Browse 470+ MIDNAM files
    - Edit and download files
    - Browser-based storage (IndexedDB) for temporary saves
    - No server-side file modifications
    
    ## Browser Storage (Hosted Mode)
    
    When deployed on Vercel, the application uses browser-based IndexedDB storage to save edits locally:
    - Saves persist across browser sessions
    - Stored per-domain (not synced across devices)
    - Users can load, download, or delete saved edits
    - "My Edits" section in Tools tab manages browser-saved files

    Browser Storage (Client-Side):
    When deployed on Vercel, MIDNAMaker uses browser IndexedDB for temporary saves.
    The storage module (js/core/storage.js) provides methods to save, load, and manage MIDNAM files locally.
    The "My Edits" section in the Tools tab provides UI for managing browser-saved files.
